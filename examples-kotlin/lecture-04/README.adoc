= Lecture 04

In this lecture, we learned about object-based concepts, mainly their _identity_, _equality_, and _comparability_.

The examples showcase how to use these concepts in Kotlin.

== Concepts

For *identity*, the operators `===` and `!==` are used.

For *equality*, the operators `==` and `!=` are used.
They call the `equals` method of objects under the hood.
If objects override the `equals` method, the `hashCode` method should also be overridden.

For *comparability*, two options can be used.
Objects either implement the `Comparable` interface, or another object is used that implements the `Comparator` interface. `Comparable` is useful if comparability is an internal concept of the object.
A `Comparator` is useful if comparability is an external concept forced upon the object.
An object can implement `Comparable` once whereas it can have multiple comparators.
